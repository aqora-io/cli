# Installation

To install the CLI, you can use pip. Note that the CLI requires Python 3.9 or greater

```bash
# with pip
pip install aqora-cli

# with pipx
pipx install aqora-cli

# on Windows with Python installed from python.org
py -m pip install aqora-cli

# on Windows with Python installed from the Windows Store
python -m pip install aqora-cli
```

## Notes for Windows users

If pip gives you a warning that the script is not on your PATH, you can copy the
directory in the warning and add it to your path by [following the instructions
here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)

You may also need to install the latest Visual C++ Redistributable Version. You
can find [the latest version here](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#latest-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-version)

# Getting Started

To verify the installation, the following should output helpful information

```bash
aqora help
```

Once the CLI has installed you can login to your account with the following command

```bash
aqora login
```
